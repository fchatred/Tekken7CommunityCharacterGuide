## **Overview**

This guide is meant to help contain a lot of info for each character in one place. Obviously primers for actual characters and their respective discords will have more info such as oki situations and general MU knowledge, however this will have a lot of stuff if you just want to pick up a new character, check out their combos, see their punishes or other things! This guide is very much a WIP and will almost always be a WIP due to new stuff being found for certain characters or balance changes.

I'd love to give credits to some awesome people who've been gracious enough to help me with this guide! Please be awesome and support each one of these people!

## _**Akuma**_ 

Difficulty - ???? 

>**Akuma is the SF guest character in T7. His design is completely unique from other Tekken characters due to his SF origins. Similar to the SF games, he has a meter gauge, where he builds the meter via doing moves on the opponent, using special moves or getting hit. He can use the meter to extend his combos and pressure or burn them on approach tools like fireballs. Once he’s in, he can abuse his powerful low options one of which that can be cancelled into fireball or tatsu point blank for a huge damaging low option as well as his sweep which knocks down for strong oki. He has a demon flip with a bunch of moves out of it that can be used to approach the opponent and to initiate pressure. Akuma gets a lot of his big damage via jumping; quite the sin in Tekken as jumping can be interrupted into big combos,  It can be hard for some characters to stop this flip. He’s a very all or nothing 50/50 character and with meter, his mixups become incredibly damaging and safe. He has a shoryuken which is invincible at the start, meaning he can disrespect a lot of pressure and make the opponent be wary about applying pressure on Akuma. With meter, his jabs become the best punisher in the game as he can do jab cancels into shoryuken meter cancel for huge damage on anything unsafe.**

**Pros:**

* Has a shoryuken for a panic move
* Best punishment in the game with meter.
* Strong 50/50 game
* Strong oki
* Huge damage output

**Cons:**

* Needs meter for damage
* Unsafe on his mixups
* Has poor range, needs to be up close a lot of the time

**Recommended for players who like:**

* Street Fighter
* Unique characters

## _**Alisa**_

Difficulty - Easy 

>**Alisa makes her return in T7. Alisa is a very poke oriented character. She excels at slowly chipping down the opponent with good ranged low and mid pokes. Combine that with her strong sidestep and she's perfect for players who like to play a slow methodical paced game. She has an incredibly strong homing move in 4, a i13 CH launching homing move; this is really good at discouraging the opponent to step allowing Alisa to bully them with pokes. She can also get aggressive and cover space quite quickly with WR2, a high-damage ranged attack that puts her in a very favorable position if blocked.  Opponents have to try to predict this attack and either duck or sidestep it which leaves them vulnerable to her poking game. As Alisa is very poke centric, her damage can fall behind as she doesn’t have a lot of moves to make comebacks with.**

**Pros:**

* Decent poking game
* Safe launchers
* Strong jab punishes
* One of the best stepping in the game.
* One of the best homing moves
* Strong homing moves

**Cons:**

* Poor whiff punishment
* Poke game is low damage, she struggles on a life deficit. 
* Has to play very risky to make a comeback. 

**Recommended to players who like:**

* Simple poking game
* Low execution
* Defensive gameplay

## _**Anna**_

Difficulty - Medium

>**Nina’s sister makes her return in S2. Anna is quite an extreme character in that she is the definition of a high risk/reward character. She’s very strong at approaching the opponent with moves such as QCF1, a + on block fast CH high launcher with quick recovery, FF2 another + on block high which is a homing. With these tools, Anna is good at closing the gap with her opponent and bullies with her pokes and cancels. She has 2 main mixup scenarios, her FC game and her Chaos Judgement (CJM) stance. Her FC game has an unseeable low launcher which is also complemented by various mids from crouching. Her CJM stance has moves such as a chunky low option in CJM d33, various mid options, fast highs to condition the opponent to respect her. She has a few moves that transitions into this CJM stance, some good and some bad and it’s up to the Anna player to use them well. Anna is all about forcing herself into the opponent, conditioning them to respect her with her pokes and then applying the FC/CJM mixup situations. However her punishment is the worst in the game bar her rage art which is tied fastest and has huge range. It is sometimes encouraged to not take the punish from crouch as Anna and take the FC mixup instead. Good reads is required as an Anna player as she has big damage from her openings but they are very unsafe.**

Pros:  

* Some of the best mixups in the game
* One of the best rage arts
* Huge damage output
* Strong comeback potential
* Good approach

Cons:

* Worst punishment in the game
* Has to commit a lot 
* Inconsistent hitboxes and followups
* Awful tracking

Recommended for players who like:

* Mixup intensive characters
* Rushdown and offensive

## _**Armor King**_

Difficulty - Medium

>**AK is a really well rounded character. He has a lot of the tools the game has to offer such as varied grabs outside of generic grabs, really strong basics, good punishment on block and whiff, a super strong RD, and strong NH/CH launchers. He has strong approach with his CD1 which is a + on block high with huge range and forces the opponent to pre-emptively duck at range. He’s good at forcing whiffs with range on stuff like his generic d4, df4, df1 and so on. His damage output is quite high to complement his whiff punishment reward. He has ground throw mixups which means after certain knockdowns or wall enders, he can setup a 50/50 to add on a lot of damage onto his already high damage on a correct guess, so his comeback and oki game is quite strong. His Rage Drive is amongst the best, he spits mist at you and gets a guaranteed unbreakable grab, the only way to avoid this is to duck pre-emptively at neutral since it is unseeable, opening the opponent up to his grabs. His lows aren’t the best so it’s encouraged to use his grabs/rage drive to make them duck. His 11f ws4 is strong but it’s all he has til he can launch from crouch.**

Pros:  

* Strong grab game
* Decent oki
* High damage output
* Amazing basics
* One of the better rage drives

Cons:

* Medicore lows
* Ws punishment is meh

Recommended for players who like:

* Strong basic characters
* Grab games

## _**Asuka**_

Difficulty - Easy

>**Asuka is an extremely defensive CH oriented character in T7. She is quite strong at keeping her opponent at a distance with her ranged mids and lows. This makes it hard for the opponent to approach Asuka with her plethora of keepout tools and to top this off, Asuka has one of the game’s best and easiest whiff punisher with f2 to punish any whiffs at a huge range. Once the opponent makes it through Asuka’s keepout, they’ll find themselves struggling to get hits on her due to her having the best panic moves in the game; including a safe i14 CH launcher that low crushes early, a safe evasive move and her reversals, as well as being a relatively safe character overall.  Asuka’s offense is decent at best, the main idea behind it is “mental frame advantage”, meaning that she’s very good at making the opponent second guess their turn to attack. While Asuka bullies the opponent down with her amazing jab strings and upclose pokes, they have to challenge her eventually and with her strong anti-button tools, they can pay the price dearly for it. She has some of the game’s best mid launchers, both on normal hit and CH. Her okizeme has been buffed a lot in T7 from TTT2, gaining access to an extremely strong grounded hitting move with her Rage Drive and a mid unblockable. However, Asuka does have one of the worst WS punishment in the game as her fastest launcher is i19 from WS, so it’s encouraged to try and read lows with her and crush them as opposed to blocking them. Her jab punish is the worst i10 punish in the game meaning it can be hard for Asuka to steal the lifelead back from her opponent if they play safely.**

Pros:  

* One of the best whiff punishers in the game
* Strong okizeme
* Best arsenal of panic moves
* Strong keepout
* Big arsenal of safe mid launchers and CH launchers.
* Strong CH game

Cons:

* Worst jab punish
* One of the worst WS punishers
* Struggles vs defensive players

Recommended for players who like:

* Defensive characters
* Strong and unique oki 
* Easy and effective characters

## _**Bears**_

Difficulty - Medium

>**The iconic duo makes their return to T7. Despite Kuma and Panda having separate character slots, they are the exact same character; the only difference lies in their Rage Arts. The bears have access Hunting Bear Stance (HBS) which is a very momentum based stance. They have access to a fast low string, damaging knockdown lows and strong mids with the ability to lower their hitbox to go even under a lot of mids. Good usage of this stance is required to play Bears well as they can get a lot of mileage off it. This can be achieved with good reads and conditioning the opponent well. Due to their extensive reach on their arms, any attacks involving 1 or 2 input has extended reach. This gives them a very strong jab keepout game and they have various mids/lows involving those punch inputs. Combine this with one of the best and easiest whiff punishers in the game with df21 and the Bears can effectively keep the opponent in check at range. This allows them to choose their moments to approach with HBS to rack up damage. Bears have stubby legs. This can be a double edged sword; whilst the reach in their legs is poor, certain lows whiff where they would hit other characters and certain characters must use shorter combos due to their shorter leg length. Because of their hitbox, they are vulnerable to bigger wall combos and specific combo starters but some characters are forced to use shorter combos on them in the open due to their short legs. They also have a pretty bad SS so they are prone to more offense than other characters.**

Pros:  

* One of the best whiff punishers if not the best.
* Strong offensive stance 
* Short legs so can be hard to judge range vs them
* One of the best hopkicks.

Cons:

* Poor offense outside of stance
* Amongst the worst for SSing
* Prone to bigger wall combos and Bear specific combo starters

Recommended for players who like:

* Conditioning and hard reads
* Easy whiff punishment
* Party kinda style

## _**Bob**_

Difficulty - Easy

>**Bob is an extremely well rounded character that can allow the player to play a variety of playstyles. He has a very strong poking game with good mids, CH launchers and low pokes. Not only is he a strong poking character, Bob can up the tempo and go in with hard hitting lows. One of his lows db3+4,4 is one of the most infamous lows in Tekken. It does big damage for a low and leaves the opponent in his face at a huge disadvantage. This makes his wall game one of the best in T7 as the opponent cannot backdash followup pressure. He has plenty of safe mids to complement this, one of them being super evasive as well. Furthermore he has a command dash allowing him to close the gap quickly between himself and the opponent, along with having good tracking; meaning it can be hard to move around his pressure. He has very strong punishment but he does lack a launcher for -15 from standing. However he does have a i14 WS launcher to punish lows harder than most.**

Pros:  

* Very versatile playstyle.
* Super strong poking game
* One of the best wall games
* Good approach
* High damage output at wall
* Strong punishment outside of no i15 launcher

Cons:

* No i15 launcher

Recommended for players who like:

* Well rounded characters
* Easy and effective 
* Versatile playstyle with tons of options

## _**Bryan**_

Difficulty - Advanced

>**Bryan is renown for his amazing blend of keepout and rushdown, and Tekken 7 is no different. He has plenty of tools to keep his opponent at range with ranged CH launchers, backsway evasive moves if they approach recklessly and a safe mid launcher that low crushes with quick recovery. He also has a mid CH launcher with huge range and + frames if he needs to put himself at the opponent’s face. Once he is in there, he can work his opponent down with hard hitting lows, a fast CH mid launcher that’s neutral on block, powerful jab strings, hitconfirmable strings and so on. His offense is not only damaging but also relatively safe. Moreover, he has some of the best spacing tools the game has to offer. There is a steep execution curve to Bryan if you want to get into the really silly stuff available to him, such as the infamous “taunt jet upper” which is forcing your opponent to eat an unblockable taunt into a guaranteed launcher followup. This is extremely hard to pull off but it’s very practical to be able to do consistently. A noticeable flaw that Bryan has is that he is very weak to his left so the opponent’s right, but he has strong hitting homing moves to cover this.**

Pros:  

* One of the best space control
* i14 launcher standing (standard is i15)
* Damaging and relatively safe offense
* Huge comeback potential
* Strong CH game
* Damaging homing moves.
* Good whiff punishers
* High combo damage output

Cons:

* Weak tracking to his left
* Not much going for huge + frames on hit
* Weak standing punishing until i14

Recommended for players who like:

* Well rounded characters
* High execution curves/flashy stuff
* Strong defense oriented playstyle

## _**Claudio**_

Difficulty - Easy

>**Replacing Lars as the most anime character, Claudio is the first of the new additions to Tekken 7. Claudio is unique in the fact that he gains something close to a “devil trigger install” from connecting with certain moves. His hand gains a blue flame called Starburst which grants him a one time buff for specific moves. Claudio is infamous for having the best hopkick in the game with huge range and quick recovery, therefore it’s awkward to block/whiff punish making it a strong keepout tool. He also has one of the strongest approach tools with his WR2, a hugely + on block high that forces his opponent to duck at a range and Claudio can start using ranged mids such as the aforementioned hopkick to condition them. Claudio’s main gameplan is to get into Starburst as soon as he can to use the juiced up versions of Starburst compatible moves to overwhelm his opponent. His poking game isn’t amazing as his generic mid poke is slower than most and his fastest mid is a bit unfavourable on block. His main lows are damaging but they are quite risky (launch punishable) on block except one making his offense a dangerous one for him to take.**

Pros:  

* Best hopkick in the game
* Highest damage output with STB enabled 
* Good homing moves
* One of the best whiff punishers in the game with STB
* Strong keepout with hopkick
* One of the best approach with WR2

Cons:

* Limited poking game
* Mediocre lows
* Unsafe offense for the most part

Recommended for players who like:

* High damage output chars
* Unique powerup character

## _**Devil Jin**_

Difficulty - Advanced

>**Compared to the other Mishimas, Devil Jin can be considered the “well-rounded” one of the 3. He has stronger pokes than Kazuya and better safety and lows than Heihachi, but he’s not as hard hitting as Kazuya or as CH heavy as Heihachi. As a Mishima, he has access to the standard Mishima tools, EWGF (+5 on block high launcher with good recovery), hellsweep (hard hitting low, his version trips the opponent up for a combo), strong jab hitconfirms and a wavedash to close the gap between himself and the opp with ease. His poking game is quite strong as he has a variety of lows to choose from depending on the situation. Whether it’s hard hitting with hellsweeps, simple poke pressure with db2 and d4 and plenty of strong mid poke strings to complement this. He has the usual Mishima strong space control with EWGF and his own unique ranged mids to dictate the pace with. He also has a strong panic move in u4 which can be a mixup on block vs specific characters.**

Pros:  

* Strong poking game
* Strong space control
* Strong mixup game
* Great mobility
* High damage output
* Good panic moves

Cons:

* ????

Recommended for players who like:

* Strong poking chars
* Well rounded chars
* Ability to change up pace at player’s own discretion.

## _**Lili**_

Difficulty - Medium

>**Nina’s sister makes her return in S2. Anna is quite an extreme character in that she is the definition of a high risk/reward character. She’s very strong at approaching the opponent with moves such as QCF1, a + on block fast CH high launcher with quick recovery, FF2 another + on block high which is a homing. With these tools, Anna is good at closing the gap with her opponent and bullies with her pokes and cancels. She has 2 main mixup scenarios, her FC game and her Chaos Judgement (CJM) stance. Her FC game has an unseeable low launcher which is also complemented by various mids from crouching. Her CJM stance has moves such as a chunky low option in CJM d33, various mid options, fast highs to condition the opponent to respect her. She has a few moves that transitions into this CJM stance, some good and some bad and it’s up to the Anna player to use them well. Anna is all about forcing herself into the opponent, conditioning them to respect her with her pokes and then applying the FC/CJM mixup situations. However her punishment is the worst in the game bar her rage art which is tied fastest and has huge range. It is sometimes encouraged to not take the punish from crouch as Anna and take the FC mixup instead. Good reads is required as an Anna player as she has big damage from her openings but they are very unsafe.**

Pros:  

* Some of the best mixups in the game
* One of the best rage arts
* Huge damage output
* Strong comeback potential
* Good approach

Cons:

* Worst punishment in the game
* Has to commit a lot

## _**Marduk**_

Difficulty - Medium

>**The Vale Tudo champion makes his return to Tekken and he’s stronger than ever. As always Marduk has an amazing selection of lows, from poke lows to power mixup lows to high crush lows etc he has it all. He has strong mids to complement these lows with as well, tons of safe CH launchers (albeit slow, so takes some conditioning) and good jab pressure and mindgames. The main thing Marduk has to offer is his tackle mixups, which can be enforced from raw tackle, throws, his reversal or rage drive. Once he’s on top of you, you have to guess between 3 options, 1, 2 or 1+2 which he can also fake out to make it hard to react to. His damage output is immensely high and on top of that, he can use rage drive at the end of combos to mount and add on even more damage through guesses. His oki is notoriously one of the best between his ground grabs and ways to blow people up by  attempting to stand up off many knockdowns/grabs. His Vale Tudo Stance (VTS) has a power mixup in it through a trip low and many mids, he can access his VTS from many moves so there’s a lot of mindgames behind his cancels. His grab game is also one of the best to no surprise. His WS punishment is pretty poor though, only getting a launcher way later than average. His homing’s aren’t the best so it’s encouraged to know the tracking on his moves.**

Pros:  

* One of the best oki
* One of the best rage drives
* High damage output
* Amazing lows
* Strong comeback factor

Cons:

* Poor WS punishment
* Slow homing moves

Recommended for players who like:

* Non traditional characters
* Grapplers
* Okizeme based gameplay
* High damage output
