## **Overview**

This guide is meant to help contain a lot of info for each character in one place. Obviously primers for actual characters and their respective discords will have more info such as oki situations and general MU knowledge, however this will have a lot of stuff if you just want to pick up a new character, check out their combos, see their punishes or other things! This guide is very much a WIP and will almost always be a WIP due to new stuff being found for certain characters or balance changes.

I'd love to give credits to some awesome people who've been gracious enough to help me with this guide! Please be awesome and support each one of these people!

## _**Alisa**_

Difficulty - Easy 

>**Alisa makes her return in T7. Alisa is a very poke oriented character. She excels at slowly chipping down the opponent with good ranged low and mid pokes. Combine that with her strong sidestep and she's perfect for players who like to play a slow methodical paced game. She has an incredibly strong homing move in 4, a i13 CH launching homing move; this is really good at discouraging the opponent to step allowing Alisa to bully them with pokes. She can also get aggressive and cover space quite quickly with WR2, a high-damage ranged attack that puts her in a very favorable position if blocked.  Opponents have to try to predict this attack and either duck or sidestep it which leaves them vulnerable to her poking game. As Alisa is very poke centric, her damage can fall behind as she doesn’t have a lot of moves to make comebacks with.**

**Pros:**

* Decent poking game
* Safe launchers
* Strong jab punishes
* One of the best stepping in the game.
* One of the best homing moves
* Strong homing moves

**Cons:**

* Poor whiff punishment
* Poke game is low damage, she struggles on a life deficit. 
* Has to play very risky to make a comeback. 

**Recommended to players who like:**

* Simple poking game
* Low execution
* Defensive gameplay

## _**Akuma**_ 

Difficulty - ???? 

>**Akuma is the SF guest character in T7. His design is completely unique from other Tekken characters due to his SF origins. Similar to the SF games, he has a meter gauge, where he builds the meter via doing moves on the opponent, using special moves or getting hit. He can use the meter to extend his combos and pressure or burn them on approach tools like fireballs. Once he’s in, he can abuse his powerful low options one of which that can be cancelled into fireball or tatsu point blank for a huge damaging low option as well as his sweep which knocks down for strong oki. He has a demon flip with a bunch of moves out of it that can be used to approach the opponent and to initiate pressure. Akuma gets a lot of his big damage via jumping; quite the sin in Tekken as jumping can be interrupted into big combos,  It can be hard for some characters to stop this flip. He’s a very all or nothing 50/50 character and with meter, his mixups become incredibly damaging and safe. He has a shoryuken which is invincible at the start, meaning he can disrespect a lot of pressure and make the opponent be wary about applying pressure on Akuma. With meter, his jabs become the best punisher in the game as he can do jab cancels into shoryuken meter cancel for huge damage on anything unsafe.**

**Pros:**
* Has a shoryuken for a panic move
* Best punishment in the game with meter.
* Strong 50/50 game
* Strong oki
* Huge damage output

**Cons:**
* Needs meter for damage
* Unsafe on his mixups
* Has poor range, needs to be up close a lot of the time

**Recommended for players who like:**
* Street Fighter
* Unique characters
